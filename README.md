# Installation

Before beginning, ensure you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed and their commands are globally accessible via the command line.

### Run Unit Tests

#### PHPUnit

We use PHPUnit to test out all the PHP we write. The tests are located in `tests/phpunit/unit-tests/`

Installing the testing environment is best done using a flavour of Vagrant (try [Varying Vagrant Vagrants](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV)).

1. From your terminal SSH into your Vagrant box using the `vagrant ssh` command
2. `cd` into the root of your Gravity PDF Core Booster directory
3. Run `bash tests/bin/install.sh gravitypdf_test root root localhost` where `root root` is substituted for your mysql username and password (VVV users can run the command as is).
4. Upon success you can run `vendor/bin/phpunit` and `vendor/bin/phpunit --group ajax`
